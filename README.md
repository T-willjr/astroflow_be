# AstroFlow Backend

> A rails backend for a service oriented application. A user can request and receieve data from endpoints for horoscopes and a daily flow chart. Endpoints include querying daily horoscopes, flow charts, and moon positions. Multiple API endpoints are consumed for the horoscope call, and their data is integrated into the JSON body of the response.

## Design Principles: 
The design of this application relies on the facade design pattern. Here's a very high level overview: 
* A controller receives a request from the front end and intiates the creation of a facade, and passes it data(params, from JSON or query). 
* A facade is a ruby class that initializes a Service, and sends the service data to a PORO. 
* A service calls an external api enpoint and returns parsed JSON. 
* The parsed JSON is turned into a Ruby object through a PORO. 
* The object is serialized and sent to the route matching the controller action.
